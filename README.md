# Image-Denoising-using-DNN


Traditional Image Denoising focused on extracting latent clean image from Noisy Images. This method denoises image using Residual Learning and Batch Normalization technique.

Residual Learning has following merits:
> Residual network explicitly learns a residual mapping for a few stacked layers. 
> With such a residual learning strategy, extremely deep CNN can be easily trained and improved accuracy has been achieved for image classification and object detection.


Batch Normalization has following merits:
> It helps to deal with Internal Covariate Shift problem.
> Provides fast training and better performance,
